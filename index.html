        <p id="paragraph">An Undergraduate from St. Edwards University planning to major with a Bachelor's 
        in Business Administration in 2021. I have a genuine passion for my major, 
        and every course I have taken has generated intrigue and fascination inside of me. I also like learning new things, 
        when I was young I began playing the guitar, then I became interested in producing music to create full songs. More recently,
        I dug into photography and video editing, and finally, my creativity is going towards coding and programming.
        I started trying game development and I really enjoyed it, it was challenging and fun. From there, I got interested in developing apps and websites, 
        I have not tried it but I would really like to try some app developing. That is why I am trying the Coding BootCamp at UT, it is tough, but I am learning a ton of useful information.
        In the future, I would like to work as a Product manager, software developer, or even try Business Analytics. </p>
