    <p id="paragraph">An Undergraduate from St. Edwards University planning to major with a Bachelor's 
        in Business Administration in 2021. I have a genuine passion for my major, 
        and every course I have taken has generated intrigue and fascination inside of me. I also like learning new things, 
        when I was young I began playing the guitar, then I became interested in producing music to create full songs. More recently,
        I dug into photography and video editing, and finally, my creativity is going towards coding and programming. </p>
